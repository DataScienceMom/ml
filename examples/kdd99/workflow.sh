# Summarize (the 10% subset of) the kdd99 data set. This should be the first step in any analysis you do using ML: the
# summary file contains information on the distribution of all of the numerical and categorical variables in your dataset,
# and this summary information is required to configure the MapReduce jobs run by the other tools.
#
# ML is designed to work with CSV-style data as well as Vectors (stored either as Mahout's VectorWritables in SequenceFiles
# or using our own MLVector Avro format). By convention, commandline arguments that end in "path" or "paths" refer to data
# that is stored (or will be stored) in HDFS, whereas commandline arguments that end in "file" or "files" refer to data that
# is stored (or will be stored) on the client machine. In the summary command, we are reading data from HDFS via the
# --input-paths argument, and storing the summary information we find locally in the location specified by the --summary-file
# argument.
#
# For CSV data, the summary command needs a CSV --header-file that tells it the name of each of the columns in the dataset and
# their data type. Once HCatalog integration is in place, we will pull this information in automatically. You can also specify
# that certain fields in the dataset should be ignored by the summarizer by marking their type as "ignored" or "id".
#
# The summary command runs a single MapReduce job every time it is called.

# Use the summary information that we just created to "normalize" the kdd99 data, which in this context, means converting it
# from a CSV file into a collection of Vectors. This command supports writing the data out as either VectorWritables stored
# in a SequenceFile, or as MLVectors stored in an Avro file, depending on the value of the --output-type argument.
#
# By default, the normalize command converts every level of each of the categorical variables in a dataset into multiple 0/1
# indicator variables, one for each level. You can also use the --transform command to transform the values of the numerical
# variables, either using the Z transform (mean 0, s.d. of 1) or a linear transform (normalized to be between 0 and 1.)
#
# If you specify a column name or index via the --id-column argument, ML will store that identifier with each record and
# persist it for later analysis of the data. This is almost always a good idea.
#
# The normalize command runs a single map-only job every time it is called.

# Processes the normalized vectors and runs a series of MapReduce jobs over the data that are designed to construct a good
# set of sample points to use as the input to a locally run k-means clustering algorithm. The implementation of this algorithm
# follows the description in the "Scalable k-means++" paper by Bahmani et al. (2012) but has a few optimizations in order to
# reduce the number of passes over the data required to create the sample, or "sketch."
#
# This command will partition the input data set into two folds and will construct a sketch of each of them by
# sampling --points-per-iteration points from each fold over N iterations (controlled by the --iterations argument). The
# reason for creating two folds instead of just one is that this allows us to compute a number of statistics related to the
# stability of the clustering that we can use to help us choose a good value of K from the sketches.
#
# A good rule of thumb is to have iterations * points-per-iteration be 1.5-2x greater than the largest number of clusters
# you would want to examine interactively. So for example, if you thought that you wouldn't possibly want to examine more than
# 1000 possible clusters, setting iterations * points-per-iteration to be 5 * 500 = 2500 (as we do below) would be more than
# enough points in your sketch to find a good clustering (if it exists.)
#
# The ksketch commands will run N + 1 MapReduce jobs, where N is controlled by the --iterations argument.

# Runs k-means++ on the sketch that was created by the ksketch command for multiple values of K.
#
# This command does not run on Hadoop at all, all of the computations take place on the client machine. The goal is to
# allow a data scientist to experiment with multiple values of K and multiple clusterings without requiring them to run
# additional MapReduce jobs. That said, performing these calculations can be very compute-intensive, so you may want to
# run this command on a more powerful machine.
#
# If you used multiple folds in the ksketch command, the kmeans command will use them to create both 'test' and 'train'
# clusterings over the different folds and evaluate the stability of the resulting cluster assignments and print out
# statistics about the clusterings. The values that are important for evaluating stability are: 'PredStrength', based on a
# modified version of the prediction strength calculation described in "Cluster Validation by Prediction Strength" by
# Tibshirani et al. (2005); 'StableClusters', which is the fraction of the K clusters that were deemed stable by the
# prediction strength algorithm; and 'StablePoints', which is the fraction of the total points in the test set that belonged
# to a stable cluster.
#
# For small values of K on well-clustered data, you should aim to use the largest value of K whose prediction strength exceeds
# 0.8. For larger values of K on data that is not well-clustered, you will have more small clusters that tend to be less stable,
# which will lower the prediction strength metric, and should try to weigh both the cost of the clustering (which will always
# decrease with larger K) as well as the StablePoints fraction (ideally > 90%) in choosing a value of K.
#
# Finally, you can use the --best-of parameter to perform multiple iterations of k-means++ with different starting points for
# each of your values of K in the --clusters argument.
#
# In my runs, I found that K = 20 had the best balance of cost and stability, which makes sense, given that there are 23 different
# kinds of intrusion events in my sample dataset. Values of K > 20 tend to have lower cost but are less stable (points from the
# same cluster in the test data are in different clusters in the training data), whereas K < 20 has higher costs and only marginally
# more stability than the K = 20 clustering.

# 2. Clustering ID (You can apply multiple clusterings to the data on each run via the --centers-file and --center-ids)

# 4. Distance (How far this point was from its assigned center)
#
